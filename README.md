DarkHorse Comic Organizer

Dark Horse intended to lock away your comics forever—but this script helps you keep what you paid for.

To start, download the Dark Horse Digital App (Mac), log in, and go to your books. Click on them to download. When you download your comics, a folder called “Dark Horse” is created in your ~/Library/Containers directory. This folder is assigned a dynamic UUID (a unique identifier generated by your Mac) and has the following folder structure:
Data/Documents/Bookshelf/Books. Inside the Books folder, your comics are stored in subfolders named with UUIDs. Within those subfolders, you’ll find your comic pages, but they don’t have file extensions.

The script identifies your unique Dark Horse folder using the UUID. It then navigates to the “Books” folder to find your comics. The script adds the .jpg file extension to each page and uses the manifest.json file (which contains the order for the pages) to properly organize your comics.

Once the script has sorted and renamed the files, it exports a copy of your comics as PDFs and CBZ files, saved to a folder called Output on your desktop.

	Note: A Reddit user (codeface) requested an option to choose between PDF or CBZ formats, but I haven’t implemented that yet.

Currently, your comics will still be identified by their UUIDs, as I have not found a reliable way to get the actual titles. However, I’ve included a CSV file in the Output folder with the list of UUIDs. You can manually add the comic names to this CSV and use a file renamer or another script (which I’ll hopefully release soon) to update the files. While it’s not fully automated yet, this will at least allow you to regain your digital collection.

I apologize for the situation we’re in, and I hope this script helps you recover the content you’ve purchased. My only request is that you remain honest and respectful with your comics—please don’t upload them to Pastebin or similar services. Doing so only strengthens the argument of companies like Dark Horse for withholding content.

Cheers,
Enjoy!
