DarkHorse Comic Organizer

Dark Horse intended to lock away your comics forever—but this script helps you keep what you paid for.

To start, download the Dark Horse Digital App (Mac), log in, and go to your books. Click on them to download. When you download your comics, a folder called “Dark Horse” is created in your ~/Library/Containers directory. This folder is assigned a dynamic UUID (a unique identifier generated by your Mac) and has the following folder structure:
Data/Documents/Bookshelf/Books. Inside the Books folder, your comics are stored in subfolders named with UUIDs. Within those subfolders, you’ll find your comic pages, but they don’t have file extensions.

The script identifies your unique Dark Horse folder using the UUID. It then navigates to the “Books” folder to find your comics. The script adds the .jpg file extension to each page and uses the manifest.json file (which contains the order for the pages) to properly organize your comics.

Once the script has sorted and renamed the files, it exports a copy of your comics as PDFs and CBZ files, saved to a folder called Output on your desktop.

Currently, your comics will still be identified by their UUIDs in the Output folder. Follow my instructions for gathering the comic book names from the Dark Horse website (basically you go to your bookshelf on their website, and run a command in the browser's developer console, and it outputs the names of all your books) and run my rename_cbz script and you should be good to go!

Cheers,
