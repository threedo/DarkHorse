#Once you have your comics in the "output" folder, go to digital.darkhorse.com and login. Go to your bookshelf. Click F12 to open the developer tools. Click on the console.

#Type this in and press enter... compliments of (jblaker) 

var titles = "";

$(".bookshelf-item").each(function() { 
  var uuid=$(this).attr("id");
  var title=$("p.bookshelf-item-title", $(this)).html();
  var pair = uuid + "," + title + "\r";
  titles += pair;

console.log(titles);

#It will return the UUID names of all your comics. 
#Copy the data and save it in a txt editor, google sheet, microsoft excel... etc..

#Repeat for every page in your bookshelf, until you have a master list of all the comic UUID's and their titles.

#Now add a column header in your spreadsheet called uuid and one next to it called title

#use the text to split columns feature so one column is the UUID and the other is the comic name.

#Now save that file to your downloads folder and name it uuid_mapping.csv (It must be named that exactly for the script to work).

#Now run my script titled rename_cbz.py and it will rename all your books!
